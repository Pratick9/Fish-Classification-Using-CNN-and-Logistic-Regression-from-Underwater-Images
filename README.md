# Fish-Classification-Using-CNN-and-Logistic-Regression-from-Underwater-Images
Today awareness of the human being has shifted with regard to sea. One can almost find it challenging to examine forms, types, and uses of robots by human being. Hence people employ the use of robots to survey the sea that particular robot is famously known as the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The work is directed toward the classification of fish. The embedded systems in most cases are applied in the mapping of the ocean floor. More importantly, embedded system is able to handle complex software as well as delicate technologies. In this work CNN is employed for image classification and the logistic regression model is used as a classifier. Fish4knowledge dataset is used for validation of the work. Evaluating along the measures of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, the features of the proposed work are compared with different classifiers. In this last result section, it is quite evident that logistic regression is seeing a better result than any other classifiers. In this proposed work the accuracy obtained was 95%.
